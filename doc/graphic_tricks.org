* Graphic tricks
** Antialiasing, basically, you just move a image and make it shake really fast so it looks like it's perfectly round. Just a really simple definition =P

** Magenta, color everthing you want in a image to be invisible, magenta. Just hide all magenta colors(R 255, G 000, B 255)

** Say you want a cycling image of 3 frames, such as, taking footsteps. each one is 64x64. Make the image 64x192, and show only one 64x64 square at a time.
