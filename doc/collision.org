So collision detection. The idea is simple but in practice it takes time to accomplish.

Lets start simple, shall we?
Say we have a rectangular prism, with the width w and height h. create a sphere around it with 
the 
radius w/2. 

Then say we have a cube, with the width and height of x, create a sphere around it with the 
radius x/2. 

How does this help us to do collision detection?
Well, since the spheres cover all of the inner contents, and the radius is the same all way 
around the sphere. We can easily check if collision has happened.

define y as the radius of the sphere 1, and z as the radius of sphere 2. d is the distance 
between the spheres.

if z + y >= d, you have a collision.

You can use rectangels also, any geometric primitive would do, but it is not as simple then.
